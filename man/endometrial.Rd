\format{
A data frame with 79 rows and 4 variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{NV}: neovasculization with coding 0 for absent and 1 for present
\item \code{PI}: pulsality index of arteria uterina
\item \code{EH}: endometrium height
\item \code{HG} histology grade with coding 0 for low grade and 1 for high grade
}
